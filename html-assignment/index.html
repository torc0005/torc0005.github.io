     <!-- Paragraphs -->
        <p>My name is Oussama and I'm from Algeria. I came to Canada on January 14<sup>th</sup>, 2024, with my wife and daughters. We are excited to start a new chapter in our lives here. I successfully completed <abbr title="English for academic purposes">EAP</abbr> Level 5 before starting the IMD program, which I am <em>truly</em> passionate about.
        </p>
        
        <p>Upon finishing the IMD program, my objective is to either launch a coding firm, leveraging my skills and knowledge to build innovative solutions, or embark on a thriving journey as a full-stack freelancer, delivering comprehensive web development services to diverse clientele, fueled by passion and dedication.</p>
