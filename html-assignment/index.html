        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is John Doe, and I am passionate about web development and technology. I have been learning how to code for the past few years, and I enjoy creating interactive and user-friendly websites. <em>Besides coding</em>, I love to read books and explore new places.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I volunteer at local community centers to teach kids the basics of coding. I believe that technology can empower people and bring about positive changes in society. <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and machine learning are areas that I find particularly fascinating, and I hope to delve deeper into these fields.
